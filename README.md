# MongoExpressAngularNode
Simple Demo of a Javascript full web stack implemented using the following frameworks:
- AngularJS 2 for client side scripting
- ExpressJS for rest apis on NodeJS
- Ejs for UI templating
- MongoDB (hosted online on https://mlab.com/)
- NodeJS to execute server side CRUD implementation.
Used Node Package Manager to install libraries such as :
 - body parser
 - ejs
 - mongoose (for mongoDB read write operations)

 start server
 Go to command prompt and type
 nodemon app.js

 Hit the following url on the browser : http://localhost:3000/api/setupTodos

 To continue CRUD operations read through the apiController.js file for endpoints and params to pass

 You can also use Postman utility from Google Chrome browser to test the apis.
